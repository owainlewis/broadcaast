# Broadcaast

A failed startup idea branched off from discusslr.com another similar idea.

Broadcaast lets you create channels which are containers for content (eg. status updates, images, links and videos). The idea is to allow you to group interesting content together around a specific topic or subject. (A reading list, photos about a subject, tech talks you're interested in etc) rather than the timeline of "stuff" popular with similar apps like Twitter and Instagram.

The application is based around the concept of broadcast channels which are containers for content. For instance rather than use Instagram to show your photos lumped together you might want to broadcast photos about a specific topic or subject. Users can subscribe to broadcast channels and get updates. 

If a channel is made public, other users can add things to the channel.
